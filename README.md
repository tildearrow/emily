# emily

this is tildearrow's own custom-SFML-based UI toolkit, which will be used in taebron and future applications.

this toolkit isn't production ready, but don't worry, it will be soon.

# why though?

the complexity of major UI toolkits like GTK or Qt, especially when going cross-platform.

and the desire to get a competitive, yet lightweight UI toolkit.

# dependencies

- CMake (build)

- SFML dependencies

# warning

this toolkit is tildearrow-specific, meaning that it may lack features, or may not fit your coding style.
be careful if using it on your own program.
