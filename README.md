# emily

this is tildearrow's own UI toolkit, which will be used in taebron and future applications.

this toolkit uses SDL2 (in a future will use Vulkan) for display.

this toolkit isn't production ready, but don't worry, it will be soon.

# why though?

the complexity of major UI toolkits like GTK or Qt, especially when going cross-platform.

and the desire to get a competitive, yet lightweight UI toolkit.

# warning

this is not to be confused with [razer's codename for synapse](https://insider.razerzone.com/index.php?threads/razer-synapse-crash.16528/) which has the exact same name 🙁

i just picked the name because of its meaning, and since it sounds so beautiful 😢

# and another warning

this toolkit is tildearrow-specific, meaning that it may lack features, or may not fit your coding style.
be careful if using it on your own program.
